Build Your Own Hover Racers
You can build your own hover racers by quickly modifying the examples located in the Examples Modular scene. In addition, you can also assemble your own hover racer from scratch by opening up the modules scene and moving/rotating/scaling and duplicating the modules until you have something you are happy with.

Changing Colors
If all of the included materials in this pack are not enough, you can feel free to modify the included Substance Painter file and export new textures, or to use the "mask" texture with the neutral color texture to change color in Photoshop or with script.
